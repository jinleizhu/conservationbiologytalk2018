  The \themename theme is a Beamer theme with minimal visual noise
  inspired by the \href{https://github.com/hsrmbeamertheme/hsrmbeamertheme}{\textsc{hsrm} Beamer
  Theme} by Benjamin Weiss.

  Enable the theme by loading

  \begin{verbatim}    \documentclass{beamer}
    \usetheme{metropolis}\end{verbatim}

  Note, that you have to have Mozilla's \emph{Fira Sans} font and XeTeX
  installed to enjoy this wonderful typography.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Sections}
  Sections group slides of the same topic

  \begin{verbatim}    \section{Elements}\end{verbatim}

  for which \themename provides a nice progress indicator \ldots
